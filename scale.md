## Scale
There are rwo types of scaling:

### Vertical Scaling 
In this case with the help of improving hardware such as CPU and RAM the performance of application will be improved.
For the legacy systems it could be recommended.

### Horizontal Scaling
In this case with the help of increasing application's instance on different machine or same machine with different 
virtual machines the performance will be increased. By Kubernetes and with the help of Pods and Nodes, clustering could be available which is recommended
for the application. In our design, the application has been implemented stateless that is the most important factor for Horizontal Scaling.

Apart from scaling , in case of huge number of requests per day, with the help of non-blocking, and asynchronous coding the performance of application
will be improved.
