## Assumptions
There are some assumptions inside the application : 
### Business Assumptions
1) By considering the approach is using a unidirectional asynchronous events based, and the connection
   will be up in the certain time. I supposed the game takes at most 10 minutes. Of course, it is a 
   parameter in the application properties, and could be customized.

### Technical Assumptions
1) The architecture is microservice style.

2) Methodology of development is TDD.

3) The application is developed stateless.

3) The application is developed horizontal scalable.

4) The code coverage test should be more than 80 percents.
