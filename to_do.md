# to do
To develop of the project for the future it should be considered below:

1) Using an in-memory database like ***Redis*** on top of the DB to keep the status of the game instead of 
   referring to database. Refer to disk is always consuming.
   

2) Implementing a user management module, for registration and login users, and also keeping user's activities, and
   history. User can join to the friend's game.
   
   
3) Using Metric and a monitoring system (such as Graylog, Kibana, and Sentry) to capture info, warning, errors, 
   and exceptions are necessary, and it will be set up the relevant console and applications.
